# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/simplymichael/express-user-manager/compare/v1.1.0...v2.0.0) (2020-12-20)


### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* **supported databases:** Calls to `express-user-manager.getDbDriver('mysql')` will fail. Passing connection
parameters to the constructor returned by the call to `express-user-manager.getDbDriver()` no longer
connects to the database, the `connect()` method must be explicitly called on the instantiated
object and passed the connection parameters. `express-user-manager.getDbDriver()` is now deprecated
and will be removed in an upcoming release, use `express-user-manager.getDbAdapter()` instead.

### Features
