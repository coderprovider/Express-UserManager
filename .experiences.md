# Things I learnt building this app:

1. [Iterating over Object properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/is_not_iterable)
  In JavaScript, Objects are not iterable unless they implement the iterable protocol.
  Therefore, you cannot use forâ€¦of to iterate over the properties of an object.
  Instead you have to use Object.keys or Object.entries, to iterate over the properties or entries of an object.
