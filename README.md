A user management and authentication library for Express apps.

It automatically creates and adds the following API endpoints to an Express app:

- user registration
- user login
- user logout
- user retrieval
- users listing
- user searching
- user data update
- user account deletion

Additional features include:

- customizable API endpoints
- support for multiple database engines and data-storage mechanisms
- customization of the minimum and maximum length of passwords
- specification of non-secure passwords that should not be allowed for use as passwords

**New in V3.0.0**: Support for [Hooks](#hooks)

## Installation
`npm install --save express-user-manager`

## Quick start
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const userManager = require('express-user-manager');
const app = express();

/**
 * Setup the datastore using any of the currently supported database adapters:
 *   - mongoose: for MongoDB
 *   - sequelize: for any of the other supported database engines:
 *     MySQL | MariaDB | SQLite | Microsoft SQL Server | Postgres | In-memory DB
 *     (See the section on "Built-in data stores" for supported database engines)
 */
const dbAdapter = 'mongoose'; // OR 'sequelize'
const store = userManager.getDbAdapter(dbAdapter);

// Bind the routes under [apiMountPoint] (default: ***/api/users***):
userManager.listen(expressApp, apiMountPoint = '/api/users', customRoutes = {});

(async function() {
  const server = http.createServer(app);

  // Establish a connection to the data store
  // Ensure the db is connected before binding the server to the port
  await store.connect({
    host: DB_HOST, // optional, default: 'localhost'
    port: DB_PORT, // optional
    user: DB_USERNAME, // optional
    pass: DB_PASSWORD, // optional
    engine: DB_ENGINE, // optional if the adapter is "mongoose" or if the value is "memory" and the adapter is "sequelize"; required otherwise
    dbName: DB_DBNAME, // optional, default: 'users'
    storagePath: DB_STORAGE_PATH, // optional, required if "engine" is set to "sqlite"
    debug: DB_DEBUG, // optional, default: false
    exitOnFail: EXIT_ON_DB_CONNECT_FAIL // optional, default: true
  });

  // Proceed with normal server initialization tasks
  server.listen(PORT);
  server.on('error', onError);
  server.on('listening', onListening);
 })();

// Optionally listen for and handle events
// (See the Emitted events section for more)
userManager.on(EVENT_NAME, function(data) {
  // do something with data
});
```

**Quick notes**
- The `expressApp` parameter has the following constraints:
    - It must be an express app (that is, an app created using `const app = express()`)
    - It MUST NOT be an express server, that is, it must not have been passed to `http.createServer(app)`
- The `apiMountPoint` parameter allows you to specify the base API route.
  Every request to the API will be relative to this base route. The default is `/api/users`.
- The `customRoutes` parameter is an object that allows customization of the routes.

  (See **[Specifying custom API endpoints](#specifying-custom-api-endpoints)** for more)
- If your ***expressApp*** has its own custom routing in place,
  make sure to call `userManager.listen(expressApp)` before setting up your app's custom 404 handler.

  This is because your app's 404 handler is meant to trap requests sent to routes that have no explicit handler in your app's routing system.

  Consequently, if you setup your app's custom 404 handler before calling `userManager.listen()`,
  requests to routes handled by the `userManager`'s routing system will never get to it as they will be trapped and handled by your 404 handler.

## The `init` method
The `init` method provides a shortcut way to perform the setup and initialization steps above.

It is an `async` function that runs setup and initialization tasks, connects to the database, then starts listening for requests,
all in a single step: `await init(app, options);`.

It takes two parameters:
- an express.js app as the first argument
- an object
  (with the same signature as the object passed to the **[`config`](#the-config-method)** method)
  as the second argument.

## Configuration
express-user-manager can be configured in several ways:

- using environment variables (See the **[Environment variables](#environment-variables)** section)
- using the `config` method (See **[The config method](#the-config-method)**)
- passing configuration options as the second parameter to the `init(app, options)` method
- using a combination of environment variables and the `config` method
    - if configuration is not set via `config`, then configuration values are searched in environment variables.
    - if only some configuration options are set using `config`, then the others are searched for in environment variables.
    - The configuration options set via `config` take precedence over environment variables.
    - the arguments passed to the `listen` or `init` methods take precedence over configuration options set using `config`.

### Environment variables

- **`NODE_ENV`** (*string*): The environment in which the app is running: *development*, *production*, *staging*, *test*, etc.
- **`API_MOUNT_POINT`** (*string*): The route under which to listen for API requests, default is: `/api/users`
- **`PORT`**: The port on which the server is running (or should run, if using as a stand-alone server)
- **`DB_ENGINE`**: The database engine to use. Should be one of the supported databases.
  (See **[Built-in data stores](#built-in-data-stores)**)
- **`DB_ADAPTER`**: The adapter to use. Set it to `mongoose` if using MongoDB; Set it to `sequelize` otherwise.
- **`DB_STORAGE_PATH`**: Define this only when the **DB_ENGINE** is set to `sqlite`.
- **`DB_HOST`**: The database host
- **`DB_USERNAME`**: The database user
- **`DB_PASSWORD`**: The database user's password
- **`DB_DBNAME`**: The name of the database
- **`DB_PORT`**: The port on which the database is running
- **`DB_DEBUG`**: Set to `true` or a non-zero integer to display debug output for the database.
- **`EXIT_ON_DB_CONNECT_FAIL`**: Set to `true` or a non-zero integer if the app should exit if it is unable to establish a connection to the database.
- **`SESSION_SECRET`** (*string*)
- **`AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`** (*string*)
- **`AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY`** (*number*): Authorization token expiry (in seconds)
- **`PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`** (*number*)
- **`PASSWORD_MAX_LENGTH`** (*number*)
- **`DISALLOWED_PASSWORDS`**: (*array*): A comma-separated list of weak/non-secure passwords that should not allowed to be used as passwords

**Note**: **express-user-manager** uses the [dotenv][dotenv] package,
so a quick and easy way to define the above variables is to create a ***.env*** file
at the root of your project directory, and add them to the file
and they will automatically be picked up. [Sample .env file][env]

### The `config` method
As stated earlier in the [Configuration](#configuration) section,
one of the ways you can configure *express-user-manager* is by using the `config` method.

This method provides an alternate way to pass configuration values to *express-user-manager**
if you haven't done (or are unable to do) so via environment variables.

Below is an example touching on every setting:
- **`apiMountPoint`**: (*string*) specifies the users API routes base route
- **`password`**: (*object*) for configuring minimum and maximum password length, as well as disallowed passwords
- **`routes`**: (*object*) for setting up [custom API endpoints](#specifying-custom-api-endpoints)
- **`db`**: (*object*) encapsulating database connection information
- **`security`**: (*object*) for configuring session and authorization tokens and expiry

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const userManager = require('express-user-manager');
const app = express();
const dbAdapter = 'mongoose'; // OR 'sequelize'

// Call config(options) to configure the app
userManager.config({
  apiMountPoint: {string}, // The base route under which to listen for API requests

  password: { // {object} for password configuration
    minLength: {number}, // minimum length of user passwords, default: 6,
    maxLength: {number}, // maximum length of user passwords, default: 20
    disallowed: {string | array}, // comma-separated string or array of strings considered weak/non-secure passwords
  },

  routes: { // {object} for configuring custom routes, with members
    list: {string}, // specifies the path for getting users listing
    search: {string}, // specifies the path for searching users
    getUser: {string}, // specifies the path for getting a user's details via their username, a /:{username} is appended to this path
    signup: {string}, // specifies the user registration path
    login: {string}, // specifies user authentication path,
    logout: {string}, // defines the logout path
    updateUser: {string}, // specifies the path for updating a user's data
    deleteUser: {string} // specifies the path for deleting a user, a /:{userId} is appended to this path
  },

  db: { // {object} for configuring the database connection
    adapter: {string}, // the adapter to use. valid values include 'mongoose', 'sequelize'
    host: {mixed}, // database host
    port: {number}, // database port
    user: {string}, // database user
    pass: {string}, // database user's password
    engine: {string}, // the database engine, when the adapter is set to "sequelize". values: 'memory', 'mariadb', 'mssql', 'mysql', 'postgres', 'sqlite'
    dbName: {string}, // name of the database to connect to
    storagePath: {string}, // the database storage path, only valid when "engine" is "sqlite". combined with `dbName`: `${storagePath}/${dbName}.sqlite`
    debug: {boolean}, // a value of true outputs database debug info
    exitOnFail: {boolean}, // set to true to kill the Node process if database connection fails
  },

  security: { // {object} for configuring security
    sessionSecret: {string}, // a key for encrypting the session
    authTokenSecret: {string}, // a key for signing the authorization token
    authTokenExpiry: {number}, // the expiry time of the authorization token (in seconds), example: 60 * 60 * 24
  }
});

async(() => {
  /**
   * The dbAdapter argument is not required if it is either:  
   *   - specified in the db section of the call to config or as
   *   - set using the DB_ADAPTER environment variable
   */
  const store = userManager.getDbAdapter([dbAdapter]);

  /**
   * The connectionOptions are not required if the values:
   *   - are already specified in the db section of the call to config
   *   - are set using the DB_* environment variables
   */
  await store.connect([connectionOptions]);

  // If the dbAdapter and connection values are already specified
  // via config or via environment variables,
  // then the above two calls can be tersely combined in a single call:
  // await userManager.getDbAdapter().connect();
});

// Bind request listeners
userManager.listen(expressApp);
```

**Notes on configuration settings**:
- Any of the above settings can be omitted in the call to `config` if they are already defined using environment variables.
  The exception to this is **`routes`**, which cannot be set via an environment variable.
  However, you can set it using the third parameter to the call to `listen(app, apiMountPoint, routes)`.
- If a setting is defined as an environment variable and also set in the call to `config`,
  the value set in `config` will take precedence and be used instead.
- The **`apiMountPoint`** can be set (in increasing order of precedence):
    - using the environment variable **API_MOUNT_POINT**
    - using the **`apiMountPoint`** key in the options to `config`
    - as the second parameter to the call to `listen(app, apiMountPoint, routes)`

### Specifying custom API endpoints
To customize the request paths, either:
- pass a `routes` property with the API endpoints to `config`:
  ```javascript
  userManager.config({
    routes: customApiEndpoints
  });

  userManager.listen(expressApp, apiMountPoint);
  ```
- pass an object with the API endpoints as the last parameter to `userManager.listen`:
  `userManager.listen(expressApp, apiMountPoint, customApiEndpoints)`

Below is the default definition of the API Endpoints, which can be modified for your custom routes:
```javascript
const customApiEndpoints = {
  list       : '/',       // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/
  search     : '/search', // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/search
  getUser    : '/user',   // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/user/:username
  signup     : '/',       // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/
  login      : '/login',  // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/login
  logout     : '/logout', // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/logout
  updateUser : '/',       // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/
  deleteUser : '/user',   // Resolves to [apiMountPoint]/user/:userId
};
```

#### API endpoints object properties
As seen above, the default object has a number of properties, each corresponding to a request path:
- **list** : Specifies the path to get users listing
- **search** : Specifies the path to search for users
- **getUser** : Specifies the path to get a user by username
(a `/:username` is automatically appended to the end of this route)
- **signup** : Specifies the path for creating (i.e., registering) a new user
- **login** : Specifies the path for logging in a user (an authorization key is returned on successful login)
- **logout** : Specifies the path to log out a user
- **updateUser**: Specifies the path for updating user information
- **deleteUser** : Specifies the path for deleting user by id
(a `/:userId` is automatically appended to the end of this route)

## Built-in middlewares
The **userManager** module provides some middlewares.
You can get them by calling: `userManager.get('middlewares');`.
This will return an object with the following middlewares:
- **authorized**:
  For protected resources.
  It ensures an access/authorization token is sent along with the request
  using the ***Authorization*** header.
- **loadUser**:
  Loads the current user (identified by *username*) into the request,
  to that it is available to every other middleware in the middleware chain.
  The username is sent as part of the request parameters (*request.params*)
- **loggedIn**:
  Ensures a user is logged in before they can perform the requested action.
- **notLoggedIn**
  Ensures that the target action is available only to users who are not logged in.
  For example, registration and login should (normally) not be permissible
  if the current user is already logged in.
- **restrictUserToSelf**:
  Constrains a user to performing certain actions only on their own account.

## Hooks
Hooks are a mechanism to allow you hook into different parts of the application's lifecycle.

### Available hooks
- <a name="request-hooks">**Request hooks**</a>: allow you define and register custom request middlewares.
  They give you the ability to modify the request any way you see fit.

  Request hooks are called first before any other middleware in the middleware chain is called.
  This gives you great flexibility in modifying the request before handing it over to other middleware functions in the chain.
- <a name="response-hooks">**Response hooks**</a>: let you define and register custom response-modifying functions.

  Response hooks are called just before the response is sent back to the client,
  giving you the ability to modify the response before it gets to the client.

  **Note**: Currently, response hooks are only fired when the HTTP response status code is 200.

You can register a request or response hook for a single route, for multiple routes, or for all routes.

#### Registering request and response hooks
To register a request or response hook:
- define a middleware, which is just a fancy word for a function that takes three parameters: `req`, `res`, `next`.

  If you intend to hand over processing to the next handler in the chain (recommended),
  remember to call `next()` from within your middleware when you are done; Or call `next(error)` to pass execution to the error handler.
- decide on which route (or routes) the middleware should be registered for: single-route, multi-route, global.
  The route(s) should correspond to a key or keys in the [API endpoints configuration object](#api-endpoints-object-properties).

  Multiple hooks can be registered on a given route.
- Register the hook:
    - call `userManager.addRequestHook(target, middlewareFn)` to register a request hook
    - call `userManager.addResponseHook(target, middlewareFn)` to register a response hook

  The first parameter to `addRequestHook` or `addResponseHook` is a string or an array of strings that specify the target of the hook.
  Possible values include:
    - `*`: represents a global hook, which will register the hook for every path
    - pathName, e.g `login`: represents a single-route hook, which will register the hook for the specified route
    - list of pathNames, e.g `['login', 'signup', ...]`: represents multi-route hooks, which will register the hook for every path in the array

#### Registering hooks: examples
- Register a request hook for every route:
  ```javascript
  userManager.addRequestHook('*', function(req, res, next) {
    // Do something interesting here, with the request or the response.
    req.accessTime = Date.now();

    // Call next to pass control onto the next middleware function
    next();
  });
  ```
- Register a response hook for the signup route:
  ```javascript
  userManager.addResponseHook('signup', function(req, res, next) {
    // You can for example set/append custom response headers:
    res.append('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', '<CUSTOM_HEADER>');
  });
  ```
- Register a response hook for multiple (*login* and *signup*) routes:
  ```javascript
  userManager.addResponseHook(['login', 'signup'], function(req, res, next) {
    // Do something tangible
    res.body.data.authenticated = true;
  });
  ```
- Register a list of request hooks along with their corresponding function identifiers:
  ```javascript
  userManager.addRequestHook(['login', 'signup'], ['loginFnId', 'signupFnId'])
  ```
- Register multiple response hooks for a single (*signup*) route:
  ```javascript
  userManager.addResponseHook('signup', [callback1, callback2, ...]);
  ```

#### Unregistering request and response hooks
You also have the ability to unregister a hook when the hook is no longer needed.
And you can unregister hooks globally, for only some routes, or for a single route.

- To unregister a request hook, call `userManager.removeRequestHook(route [, callback])`.

  If the optional `callback` parameter is not specified, every hook registered to that route will be removed.
  Otherwise, only the particular callback function specified for the hook is removed.
- To unregister a response hook, call `userManager.removeResponseHook(route, [callback])`;

  If the optional `callback` parameter is not specified, every hook registered to that route will be removed.
  Otherwise, only the particular callback function specified for the hook is removed.

#### Unregistering hooks: examples
- Unregister every request hook:
  ```javascript
  userManager.removeRequestHook('*');
  ```
- Unregister every response hook for the user signup route:
  ```javascript
  userManager.removeResponseHook('signup');
  ```
- Unregister only a request callback hook for the signup route:
  ```javascript
  UserManager.removeRequestHook('signup', fn);
  ```

  `fn` should be a named function registered with `userManager.addRequestHook('signup', fn)`;

  Anonymous functions cannot be unregistered this way.
- Unregister a list of request hooks along with their corresponding function identifiers:
  ```javascript
  userManager.removeRequestHook(['login', 'signup'], ['loginFnId', 'signupFnId']);
  ```
- Unregister every response hook for the passed routes list:
  ```javascript
  userManager.removeRequestHook(['login', 'signup']);
  ```
- Unregister multiple request hooks for a single (*login*) route:
  ```javascript
  userManager.removeRequestHook('login', [fn1, fn2, ...]);
  ```

## Usage as a stand-alone server
The package comes with a built-in express server that allows you run it as a stand-alone server.

To run it as a stand-alone server, do the following:  
- Ensure you have a server running for your preferred database engine.
  (See **[Setting up test databases](#setting-up-test-databases)** for some examples)
- Define the environment variables listed in the **[Environment variables](#environment-variables)** section.
- start the server, using one of these two methods:
    - Run `node express-user-manager/src/server` from within the parent directory containing the express-user-manager package.
    - `require('express-user-manager/src/server')();` from within a `node.js` script. For example, inside an `index.js` file.
      Then run the file using node: `node index.js`.

**Note**: The built-in server runs using the default route/path settings. That means:
- it runs under the `/api/users` base route (mount point).
- it uses the default request paths. (See the section on **[Requests and responses](#requests-and-responses)**)

## Requests and responses
Every route below is assumed to begin (i.e., prefixed) with the base API route (or mount point).
The default base API route is **`/api/users`**.

- **Create user**
    - route: `POST /`
    - protected: `false`
    - request headers: none
    - request parameters: none
    - request body: `{ firstname, lastname, username, email, password, confirmPassword }`
    - response:
      ```javascript
      {
        "data": {
          "user": { id, firstname, lastname, fullname, email, username, signupDate }
        }
      }
      ```
- **Get user details by username**
    - route: `GET /user/USERNAME`
    - protected: false
    - request headers: none
    - request parameters: none
    - request body: none
    - response:
      ```javascript
      {
        "data": {
          "user": { id, firstname, lastname, fullname, email, username, signupDate }
        }
      }
      ```
- **Retrieve list of users**
    - route: `GET /`
    - protected: `false`
    - request headers: none
    - request parameters:
        - `firstname` (string, optional): get users matching {firstname}
        - `lastname` (string, optional): get users matching {lastname}
        - `sort` (string, optional)
        - `page` (number, optional, default = 1)
        - `limit` (number, optional, default = 20)
    - request body: none
    - response:
      ```javascript
      {
        "data": {
          "total": TOTAL_COUNT_OF_MATCHING_RESULTS,
          "length": COUNT_OF_CURRENT_RESULTS_RETURNED, // determined by "page" and "limit"
          "users": [
            { id, firstname, lastname, fullname, email, username, signupDate },
            { id, firstname, lastname, fullname, email, username, signupDate },
            ...
          ]
        }
      }
      ```
- **Search for users**
    - route: `GET /search?query=SEARCH_TERM`
    - protected: `false`
    - request headers: none
    - request parameters:
        - `query` (string, required)
        - `sort` (string, optional)
        - `by` (string, optional)
        - `page` (number, optional, default = 1)
        - `limit` (number, optional, default = 20)
    - request body: none
    - response:
      ```javascript
      {
        "data": {
